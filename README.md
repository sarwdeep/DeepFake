# DeepFake Detection Project

## Overview

The **DeepFake Detection Project** leverages the power of AI/ML techniques to analyze and identify whether a given photo, audio, or video is real or fake. With the increasing sophistication of deepfake technology, this project aims to provide a reliable and accessible tool to detect manipulated media content. The front-end interface of this project is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, making it user-friendly and responsive.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Detects whether an image has been manipulated or generated by deepfake techniques.
- **Audio Analysis**: Analyzes audio files to determine if the voice is authentic or artificially generated.
- **Video Analysis**: Evaluates video content to identify if it contains any deepfake elements.
- **AI/ML Model Integration**: Uses machine learning models to accurately classify media as real or fake, providing results with high reliability.
- **Web Interface**: A simple and interactive web interface developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, making it easy for users to upload and analyze media files.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: [Include any backend technology if applicable, e.g., Flask, Node.js, etc.]
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pre-trained DeepFake Detection Models
- **Libraries**: jQuery, Tesseract.js (if applicable), other ML-related libraries

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepFake.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd DeepFake
```

### 3. Install dependencies (for backend or ML models, if applicable)
If you have any backend or ML model dependencies, install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application
For a local setup, start the application by running:
```bash
[Backend-specific command, e.g., python app.py or npm start]
```

### 5. Open the application
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or any other port your app is running on) in your browser to access the DeepFake Detection interface.

## Usage

1. **Upload a Photo, Audio, or Video**: Use the simple UI to upload any media file that you wish to analyze.
2. **Run Detection**: After uploading the file, the system will run its AI/ML models to determine if the media is real or fake.
3. **View Results**: Once the analysis is complete, the system will provide a result that indicates whether the media is real or fake, with confidence scores.
